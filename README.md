# Predict Credit Scoring from one of the Bank in South East Asia

CIMB 3D Conquest In-country Indonesia 2018

Data Hackathon for 21 hours created by CIMB Niaga Bank.

We were tasked to predict which customers will miss their loan repayments based on the customer's banking data & partner telco data.

Due to confidentiality reasons, I can't share any data in public because of data owned by the CIMB Niaga Bank.

Competed with team SurabayaMining (me, Stephen Jaya G., and Grace Angelica).
